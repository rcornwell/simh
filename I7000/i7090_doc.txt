The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed instructions.
This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU HISTORY commands:

        SET CPU HISTORY         clear history buffer
        SET CPU HISTORY=0       disable history
        SET CPU HISTORY=n       enable history, length = n
        SHOW CPU HISTORY        print CPU history
        SHOW CPU HISTORY=n      print first n entries of CPU history

2.2 I/O Channels (CH0..CH8)

The 7090 supports up to 8 channels.  Channel models include

        7607            standard multiplexor channel
        7289            high speed drum channel
        7909            advanced capabilities channel

Channel A is required and is always a 7607. Channel are represented by
a number: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, G=7, H=8.

        SET CHn 7607    Sets channel to be a 7607 type.
        SET CHn 7909    Sets channel to be a 7909 type.
        SET CHn 7289    Sets channel to be a 7289 type. (For CTSS Drum).

        SET CHn FIXED   Fixes channel to specific type.
        SET CHn AUTO    Defualt, channel configures based on devices on it.

Generally there is no need to worry about channel configurations, in 
auto mode they will configure to correct type to support devices attached
to them. Or you will get an error when you attempt to run the simulation
if there is a conflict.

Channel 0 is a puesdo channel for 704 devices. Currently unit CR3, CP3, LP3,
DR0, and MTD are set to this device.

Channels have the following registers:

        name       type         size    comments
        ADDR       all          16      channel data address.
        CMD        all           6      channel command. (S/1/2/3 & 18/19)
        WC         all          15      channel word count.
        ASM        all          36      current channel assembly register.
        LOCATION   all          16      channel location counter.
        STATUS     all          16      channel device status.
        SENSE      7909         16      additional device controls.
        COUNTER    7909          6      channel counter.
        SMS        7909          7      channel SMS register.

For meaning of bits in STATUS and SENSE see i7090_defs.h.

2.3 Channel 7607 Devices and 704 devices.

2.3.1 711 Card Reader (CDR)

The card reader (CDR) reads data from a disk file.  Cards are simulated
as ASCII lines with terminating newlines.  

Card reader files can either be text (one character per column) or
column binary (two characters per column).  The file type can be
specified with a set command:

        SET CDRn FORMAT=TEXT     sets ascii text mode
        SET CDRn FORMAT=BINARY   sets for binary card images.
        SET CDRn FORMAT=BCD      sets for BCD records.
        SET CDRn FORMAT=CBN      sets for column binary BCD records.
        SET CDRn FORMAT=AUTO     Automaticly determines format.
        SET CDRn CHAN=n          Sets channel to n

or in the ATTACH command:

        ATT CDRn <file>          attaches a file

The card reader can be booted with the:

        BOOT CDRn                loads either the first 2 words or
                                3 words depending on channel.

Error handling is as follows:

        error                   processed as

        not attached            report error and stop

        end of file             out of cards

        OS I/O error            report error and stop

2.3.2 721 Card Punch (CDP)

The card reader (CDP) writes data to a disk file.  Cards are simulated
as ASCII lines with terminating newlines. 

Card punch files can either be text (one character per column) or
column binary (two characters per column).  The file type can be
specified with a set command:

        SET CDPn FORMAT=TEXT     sets ascii text mode
        SET CDPn FORMAT=BINARY   sets for binary card images.
        SET CDPn FORMAT=BCD      sets for BCD records.
        SET CDPn FORMAT=CBN      sets for column binary BCD records.
        SET CDPn FORMAT=AUTO     Automaticly determines format.
        SET CDPn CHAN=n          Sets channel to n

or in the ATTACH command:

        ATT CDPn <file>          attaches a file

Error handling is as follows:

        error                   processed as

        not attached            report error and stop

        OS I/O error            report error and stop

2.3.3 716 Line Printer (LP)

The line printer (LP) writes data to a disk file as ASCII text with
terminating newlines. Currently set to handle standard signals to 
control paper advance.

        SET LPn NO/ECHO         Sets echoing to console of lineprinter output.
        SET LPn CHAN=n          sets channel for this device

Error handling is as follows:

        error                   processed as

        not attached            report error and stop

        OS I/O error            report error and stop

The Printer supports the following SPRA n selection pulses for controlling
spacing (spacing occurs before the line is printed):

        SPRA    2               Single space.
        SPRA    1               To top of form.
        SPRA    3               Double space.
        SPRA    4               Triple space.
        SPRA    9               Suppress linefeed after print.

        SPT                     Will skip if any printer line has been pulsed.

        Defualt with no SPRA is to single space before printing.


2.3.4 729 Magnetic Tape (MTA-D)

These come in groups of 10 units each. The controller defines which channel
the devices will be on.

        SET MTx CHAN=n          Set magtape to channel n. x = A|B|C|<nothing>.

Each individual tape drive support several options: MTA used as an example.

        SET MTAn ONLINE         Sets the mag tape drive online.
        SET MTAn OFFLINE        Sets the mag tape drive offline and not ready.
        SET MTAn REWIND         Sets the mag tape to the load point.
        SET MTAn LOCKED         Sets the mag tape to be read only.
        SET MTAn WRITEENABLE    Sets the mag tape to be writeable.
        SET MTAn LOW            Sets mag tape to low density.
        SET MTAn HIGH           Sets mag tape to high density.

Options: Density LOW/HIGH does not change format of how tapes are written. And
is only for informational purposes only.

Online/Offline is part of a optional RPQ for the 7090 which adds the DRS/TRS
instructions.

       DRS  drive         Will set drive to offline after current command is
                          finished. Drive is not unloaded and can be reenabled
                          by setting it online.
       TRS  drive         Tests to see if the drive is online. If the drive
                          is there and online it will skip the next instruction
                          otherwise it takes the next instruction. 

These instructions were put in since accessing a unloaded tape drive would
hang the CPU.

Tape drives can be booted with:
        BOOT MTxn

2.3.4 ChronoClock.

Disabled by default. This is a special 729 tape drive which returns the 
current time. It supports the option of setting the channel and drive
that it will occupy. Note: You must disable the real 729 drive that is
is replacing.

        SET CHRON CHAN=n        Set channel for chrono clock.
        SET CHRON UNIT=n        Sets the unit for the chrono clock.

Example: To set Chronoclock to unit A9 do the following:

        SET MTA9 DISABLE
        SET CHRON UNIT=9 CHAN=A


2.3.5 733 Drum (DR)

This is the drum for 704/709 and possible 7090. Up to 16 units can
be attached to the CPU, all are on puesdo channel 0. Each drum is
2048K words in size. They are all stored in one file.

       SET DR0 UNITS=n

Drum unit 0 can be booted with:

       BOOT DR0

Drum unit can be assigned to a 7607 channel, but this is unsupported
by the operating systems. Drum channel is changed with:

       SET DR0 CHAN=n          where n is '*' or A-H. Channel '*' is
                               the default which is the 704 psuedo channel.
    

2.4 7909 Devices

These devices must be attached to a 7909 channel to work.

2.4.1 1301/1302/2302/7320 Disk devices

The 7631 file control supports up to ten devices, which can be 7320
drums, 1301 disks, 1302 disks, or 2302 disks.  Unit types are specified
with the SET command.  

        SET DKn TYPE=7320       unit n is a drum 
        SET DKn TYPE=7320-2     unit n is a drum (two modules).
        SET DKn TYPE=1301       unit n is a 1301 disk 
        SET DKn TYPE=130l-2     unit n is a 1301-2 disk (two modules).
        SET DKn TYPE=1302       unit n is a 1302 disk 
        SET DKn TYPE=1302-2     unit n is a 1302-2 disk (two modules).
        SET DKn TYPE=2302       unit n is a 2302 disk 

Units can be SET ENABLED or DISABLED.  In addition, units can be
set to enable or disable formatting:

        SET DKn FORMAT          enable formatting
        SET DKn NOFORMAT        disable formatting
        SET DKn HA2             enable writing of home address 2
        SET DKn NOHA2           disable writing of home address 2
        SET DKn MODULE=n        sets modules for unit, modules 
                                can only be even. 0 to 8.
        SET DKn CHAN=n          sets channel for unit (A-H).
        SET DKn SELECT=n        sets select on channel (0 or 1).
        SET DKn CTSS            sets disk to use CTSS bootstrap.
        SET DKn IBSYS           sets disk to use IBSYS bootstrap.
   
Formatting is disabled by default.

All Disk units support bootsrapping with boot command. Bootstrap code
is build based on whether CPU is in CTSS mode or not.

Error handling is as follows:

        error                   processed as

        not attached            report error and stop

        OS I/O error            report error and stop

2.4.2 Hypertape 7340 Tape drive (HTA/B)

These come in groups of 10 units each. The controller defines which channel
the devices will be on.

        SET HTx CHAN=n          Set magtape to channel n. x = A|B.
        SET HTx SELECT=n        Sets the selection mode for the channel.

Each individual tape drive support several options: HTA used as an example.

        SET MTAn LOCKED         Sets the mag tape to be read only.
        SET MTAn WRITEENABLE    Sets the mag tape to be writeable.

NOTE: Hypertape drives may not be working correctly since there is
very little documentation available on them.

Hypertape drives can be booted with:

        BOOT    HTxn


2.4.3 7750 Communications Controller (COM and COML)

The 7750 is modelled as a terminal multiplexor with 33 lines.  It consists
of two device: COM is the multiplexor controller, and COML is the indivdual
lines. For the first 32 lines, the 7750 performs input and output through
Telnet sessions connected via a user-specified listening port; the 33rd line
is permanently attached to the simulator console window.  The ATTACH command
specifies the port to be used for Telnet sessions:

        ATTACH COM <port>       set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being used
for other TCP/IP activities.

Each line (each unit of COML) can be set to one of twp modes: KSR-35 and
KSR-37.  In KSR-35 mode, lower case input and output characters are converted
automatically to upper case, and parity is ignored.  In KSR-37 mode, lower
case characters are left alone, and even parity is generated on input.
KSR-37 is the default.

Once COM is attached and the simulator is running, the 7750 listens
for connections on the specified port.  It assumes that any incoming
connection is a Telnet connections.  The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET COM DISCONNECT command,
or a DETACH COM command.

The 7750 implements the following special SHOW commands

        SHOW COM CONNECTIONS    displays current connections to the 7750
        SHOW COM STATISTICS     displays statistics for active connections

The 7750 implements the following special SET commands:

        SET COM DISCONNECT=n    disconnect line n
        SET COMLn LOG=filename  log output of line n to filename
        SET COMLn NOLOG         disable logging and close log file
        SET COMLn KSR35         set line n to KSR-35
        SET COMLn KSR37         set line n to KSR-37
        SET COMLn 2741          set line n to 2741
        SET COM CHAN=n          set channel for com controller.

The controller (COM) implements these registers:

        name            size    comments

        ENABLE          1       enable flag
        STATE           6       controller state
        MSGNUM          12      input message sequence number

2.5 7289 High-Speed Drum (HD)

The 7289 (also known as the 7320A) high-speed drum was a late
addition to CTSS.  Very little is known about the device, other
than what is used in the CTSS sources.

The drum can be changed to different channels with the
       SET HD0 CHAN=n         where n is A-H. The channel must be configured
                              as a 7289 type channel. Otherwise the drum will
                              not work.

       SET HD0 UNITS=n        Sets the number of 256K drums on the unit.


Error handling is as follows:

        error                   processed as

        not attached            report error and stop

Drum data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS
I/O errors cannot occur.


2.6 Symbolic Display and Input

The IBM 7090 simulator implements symbolic display and input.  Display is
controlled by command line switches:

        -c                      display as BCD character
        -m                      display instruction mnemonics
        -l                      display as lisp pointer. 

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by command
line switches:

        ' or -c                 BCD character
        " or -s                 BCD string
        alphabetic              instruction mnemonic
        numeric                 octal number

Instruction input uses standard 7090 assembler syntax.  There are two
basic instruction classes: memory reference and index reference.

Memory reference instructions have the format

        memref{*} address{,tag}

Index reference instructions have the format

        idxref{*} address,{tag},decrement

Specific instructions may disallow indirect addressing or limit the
size of the tag, address, or decrement fields.

Channel (I/O) instructions have the same basic two formats.

2.7 Sim Load

The load command looks at the extension of the file to determine how to
load the file.

        .crd                   Loads a card image file into memory.
                               standard 709 format + 1 card loader.
        .oct                   Loads an octal deck:
                               address <blank> octal <blank> octal...
        .sym                   Loads a 709 symbolic deck.
                               address instruction.
                               address BCD string
                               address OCT octal, octal,....
