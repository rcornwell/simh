Channels B through D, are mag tape channels 1,2,3,4.
Channels E & F, are 7908 channels for disk, hypertape or 7750.

The 7080 simulator implements several unique stop condition:

        - undefined CPU instruction
        - undefined channel instruction
        - XEC nesting exceeds limit
        - divide check on a divide and halt instruction
        - select of a non-existent channel
        - 7607 select of a 7909 channel
        - write select of a write protected device
        - invalid file control format
        - invalid message to 7750
        - no buffer storage available for input character on 7750
        - no buffer storage available for output character on 7750

The LOAD command will load a card binary image file into memory.

2.1 CPU

The CPU options include setting memory size and cpu type.

        SET CPU 702             Sets cpu to emualte 702.
        SET CPU 705             Sets cpu to emualte 705-I/II.
        SET CPU 7053            Sets cpu to emualte 705-III.
        SET CPU 7080            Sets cpu to emualte 7080.
        SET CPU 10K             Sets memory to 10K
        SET CPU 20K             Sets memory to 20K
        SET CPU 40K             Sets memory to 40K
        SET CPU 80K             Sets memory to 80K
        SET CPU 120K            Sets memory to 120K
        SET CPU 160K            Sets memory to 160K
        SET CPU NO/EMU40K       Sets emulated memory limit to 40k
        SET CPU EMU705          Sets cpu to emulate a 705-I/II.
        SET CPU EMU7053         Sets cpu to emulate a 705-III.
        SET CPU PROGRAM         Sets cpu to programable stop mode.
        SET CPU NONSTOP         Sets cpu to Non-stop mode.

The 702 can support only 10k of memory. All 705's modes can support up to
40K of memory. The 7080 can support up to 160k of memory. When in 7080 mode
the machine starts as either a 705-I/II or a 705-III depending on mode
of EMU705/EMU7053 switch. Also the EMU40K fixes the maximum memory for the
7080 to 40K until it enters 80 mode with EEM instruction.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

        name            size    comments

        IC              20      program counter
        A               256     accumulators 1
        SW911..SW916    1       sense switches 911..916
        SW              6       sense switches
        STOP            6       Stop flags
        STOPx           1       stop flags 900-905

If CPU set to PROGRAM and the stop flag is set to 1, and a 90x trigger is
generated, the machine will stop. If flag is set to 0, no stop will occur.
If CPU set to NONSTOP all errors must be checked by program.

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed instructions.
This is controlled by the SET CPU HISTORY and SHOW CPU HISTORY commands:

        SET CPU HISTORY         clear history buffer
        SET CPU HISTORY=0       disable history
        SET CPU HISTORY=n       enable history, length = n
        SHOW CPU HISTORY        print CPU history
        SHOW CPU HISTORY=n      print first n entries of CPU history

2.2 I/O Channels (CH0..CH6)

The 7080 supports up to 10 channels. Channel 0 is for unit record devices.
Channels 1 through 4 are for tape drives. These support the option of

        SET CHn UREC            tapes are on unit record device.
        SET CHn 7261            tapes are on Data Synchronizer.
        SET CHn 754             tapes are standard 705 drives.

Channels 5-10 are for 7908 devices. For CPU channels are defined as:
        Channel         CPU address
        0               0-1999
        20              2000    or 0200 
        21              2100    or 0210
        22              2200    or 0220
        23              2300    or 0230

2.3 Unit record devices.

2.3.1 711 Card Reader (CR)

The card reader (CR) reads data from a disk file.  Cards are simulated
as ASCII lines with terminating newlines.  

Card reader files can either be text (one character per column) or
column binary (two characters per column).  The file type can be
specified with a set command:

        SET CR TEXT             set text mode
        SET CR BINARY           set column binary mode
        SET CR AUTO             sets auto detect binary/text data.

or in the ATTACH command:

        ATT CR <file>           attaches a file

The card reader can be booted with the:

        BOOT CR         loads either the first 2 words or
                                3 words depending on channel.

Error handling is as follows:

        error                   processed as

        not attached            report error and stop

        end of file             out of cards

        OS I/O error            report error and stop

2.3.2 721 Card Punch (CP)

The card reader (CP) writes data to a disk file.  Cards are simulated
as ASCII lines with terminating newlines. 

Card punch files can either be text (one character per column) or
column binary (two characters per column).  The file type can be
specified with a set command:

        SET CP TEXT             set text mode
        SET CP BINARY           set column binary mode
        SET CP AUTO             set auto detect binary/text data.

or in the ATTACH command:

        ATT CP <file>           attaches a file

Error handling is as follows:

        error                   processed as

        not attached            report error and stop

        OS I/O error            report error and stop

2.3.3 716 Line Printer (LP)

The line printer (LP) writes data to a disk file as ASCII text with
terminating newlines. Currently set to handle standard signals to 
control paper advance.

        SET LP NO/ECHO          Sets echoing to console of lineprinter output.

Error handling is as follows:

        error                   processed as

        not attached            report error and stop

        OS I/O error            report error and stop

2.3.4 729 Magnetic Tape (MTA-D)

These come in groups of 10 units each. The controller defines which channel
the devices will be on.

Each individual tape drive support several options: MTA used as an example.

        SET MTAn ONLINE         Sets the mag tape drive online.
        SET MTAn OFFLINE        Sets the mag tape drive offline and not ready.
        SET MTAn REWIND         Sets the mag tape to the load point.
        SET MTAn LOCKED         Sets the mag tape to be read only.
        SET MTAn WRITEENABLE    Sets the mag tape to be writeable.
        SET MTAn LOW            Sets mag tape to low density.
        SET MTAn HIGH           Sets mag tape to high density.

Options: Density LOW/HIGH does not change format of how tapes are written. And
is only for informational purposes only.

Tape drives can be booted with:
        BOOT MTAn

2.3.4 ChronoClock.

Disabled by default. This is a special 729 tape drive which returns the 
current time. It supports the option of setting the channel and drive
that it will occupy. Note: You must disable the real 729 drive that is
is replacing.

        SET CHRON CHAN=n        Set channel for chrono clock.
        SET CHRON UNIT=n        Sets the unit for the chrono clock.

Example: To set Chronoclock to unit A9 do the following:

        SET MTA9 DISABLE
        SET CHRON UNIT=9 CHAN=A


2.4 7908 Devices

These devices must be attached to a 7908 channel to work.

2.4.1 1301/1302/2302/7320 Disk devices

The 7631 file control supports up to ten devices, which can be 7320
drums, 1301 disks, 1302 disks, or 2302 disks.  Unit types are specified
with the SET command.  

        SET DKn TYPE=7320       unit n is a drum 
        SET DKn TYPE=7320-2     unit n is a drum (two modules).
        SET DKn TYPE=1301       unit n is a 1301 disk 
        SET DKn TYPE=130l-2     unit n is a 1301-2 disk (two modules).
        SET DKn TYPE=1302       unit n is a 1302 disk 
        SET DKn TYPE=1302-2     unit n is a 1302-2 disk (two modules).
        SET DKn TYPE=2302       unit n is a 2302 disk 

Units can be SET ENABLED or DISABLED.  In addition, units can be
set to enable or disable formatting:

        SET DKn FORMAT          enable formatting
        SET DKn NOFORMAT        disable formatting
        SET DKn HA2             enable writing of home address 2
        SET DKn NOHA2           disable writing of home address 2
        SET DKn MODULE=n        sets modules for unit, modules 
                                can only be even. 0 to 8.
        SET DKn CHAN=n          sets channel for unit (40-47).
   
Formatting is disabled by default.

All Disk units support bootsrapping with boot command. Bootstrap code
is build based on whether CPU is in CTSS mode or not.

        BOOT DKn

Error handling is as follows:

        error                   processed as

        not attached            report error and stop

        OS I/O error            report error and stop

2.4.2 Hypertape 7340 Tape drive (HTA/B)

These come in groups of 10 units each. The controller defines which channel
the devices will be on.

        SET HTx CHAN=n          Set magtape to channel n. x = 40-47

Each individual tape drive support several options: HTA used as an example.

        SET HTAn LOCKED         Sets the mag tape to be read only.
        SET HTAn WRITEENABLE    Sets the mag tape to be writeable.

NOTE: Hypertape drives may not be working correctly since there is
very little documentation available on them.

Hypertape drives can be booted with:

        BOOT    HTxn


2.4.3 7750 Communications Controller (COM and COML)

The 7750 is modelled as a terminal multiplexor with 33 lines.  It consists
of two device: COM is the multiplexor controller, and COML is the indivdual
lines. For the first 32 lines, the 7750 performs input and output through
Telnet sessions connected via a user-specified listening port. The ATTACH command
specifies the port to be used for Telnet sessions:

        ATTACH COM <port>       set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being used
for other TCP/IP activities.

Each line (each unit of COML) can be set to one of twp modes: KSR-35 and
KSR-37.  In KSR-35 mode, lower case input and output characters are converted
automatically to upper case, and parity is ignored.  In KSR-37 mode, lower
case characters are left alone, and even parity is generated on input.
KSR-37 is the default.

Once COM is attached and the simulator is running, the 7750 listens
for connections on the specified port.  It assumes that any incoming
connection is a Telnet connections.  The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET COM DISCONNECT command,
or a DETACH COM command.

The 7750 implements the following special SHOW commands

        SHOW COM CONNECTIONS    displays current connections to the 7750
        SHOW COM STATISTICS     displays statistics for active connections

The 7750 implements the following special SET commands:

        SET COM DISCONNECT=n    disconnect line n
        SET COMLn LOG=filename  log output of line n to filename
        SET COMLn NOLOG         disable logging and close log file
        SET COMLn KSR35         set line n to KSR-35
        SET COMLn KSR37         set line n to KSR-37
        SET COMLn 2741          set line n to 2741
        SET COM CHAN=n          set channel for com controller.

The controller (COM) implements these registers:

        name            size    comments

        ENABLE          1       enable flag
        STATE           6       controller state
        MSGNUM          12      input message sequence number

2.6 Symbolic Display and Input

The IBM 7080 simulator implements symbolic display and input.  Display is
controlled by command line switches:

        -c                      display as BCD character
        -m                      display instruction mnemonics

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by command
line switches:

        ' or -c                 BCD character
        " or -s                 BCD string
        alphabetic              instruction mnemonic
        numeric                 octal number

Instruction input uses standard 7090 assembler syntax.  There are two
basic instruction classes: memory reference and index reference.

Memory reference instructions have the format

        memref{*} address{,tag}

Index reference instructions have the format

        idxref{*} address,{tag},decrement

Specific instructions may disallow indirect addressing or limit the
size of the tag, address, or decrement fields.

Channel (I/O) instructions have the same basic two formats.

2.7 Sim Load

The load command looks at the extension of the file to determine how to
load the file.

        .dck                   Loads autocode loader deck.
        .sym                   Loads a 7080 symbolic deck.
                               address instruction.
                               address BCD string
                               address OCT octal, octal,....
