This memorandum documents the IBM 7070 simulator.

   The IBM 7070 was introduced in June 1960, as a replacement to the IBM 650.
   It had core memory up to 10,000 10 digit words.
   The 7072 was introduced November 1962 and the 7074 on November 1961.
   The 7074 is a faster version of the 7070 with the addition of memory up
   to 40,000 10 digit words. The first 100 memory locations can be used as
   index registers. Most memory reference instructions allow for a field
   of digits to be selected to operate on and not modify the rest.

   The 7070 is a decimal machine with each word consisting of 10 digits
   plus a sign. The sign can be plus, minus or alpha. Alpha data is stored
   5 characters to a word (2 digits per character).

2.4 Mass storage devices.

2.4.1 729 Magnetic Tape (MTA-D)

These come in groups of 10 units each. The controller defines which channel
the devices will be on.

Each individual tape drive support several options: MTA used as an example.

        SET MTAn ONLINE         Sets the mag tape drive online.
        SET MTAn OFFLINE        Sets the mag tape drive offline and not ready.
        SET MTAn REWIND         Sets the mag tape to the load point.
        SET MTAn LOCKED         Sets the mag tape to be read only.
        SET MTAn WRITEENABLE    Sets the mag tape to be writeable.
        SET MTAn LOW            Sets mag tape to low density.
        SET MTAn HIGH           Sets mag tape to high density.

Options: Density LOW/HIGH does not change format of how tapes are written. And
is only for informational purposes only. Tapes can only be attached to 
channels 1 through 4.

Channel 1 support the read binary opcode to load binary tapes in octal format.

2.4.2 ChronoClock.

Disabled by default. This is a special 729 tape drive which returns the 
current time. It supports the option of setting the channel and drive
that it will occupy. Note: You must disable the real 729 drive that is
is replacing.

        SET CHRON CHAN=n        Set channel for chrono clock.
        SET CHRON UNIT=n        Sets the unit for the chrono clock.

Example: To set Chronoclock to unit A9 do the following:

        SET MTA9 DISABLE
        SET CHRON UNIT=9 CHAN=A


2.5 7907 Devices

These devices must be attached to a 7907 channel to work.

2.5.1 1301/1302/2302/7320 Disk devices

The 7631 file control supports up to ten devices, which can be 7320
drums, 1301 disks, 1302 disks, or 2302 disks.  Unit types are specified
with the SET command.  

        SET DKn TYPE=7320       unit n is a drum 
        SET DKn TYPE=7320-2     unit n is a drum (two modules).
        SET DKn TYPE=1301       unit n is a 1301 disk 
        SET DKn TYPE=130l-2     unit n is a 1301-2 disk (two modules).
        SET DKn TYPE=1302       unit n is a 1302 disk 
        SET DKn TYPE=1302-2     unit n is a 1302-2 disk (two modules).
        SET DKn TYPE=2302       unit n is a 2302 disk 

Units can be SET ENABLED or DISABLED.  In addition, units can be
set to enable or disable formatting:

        SET DKn FORMAT          enable formatting
        SET DKn NOFORMAT        disable formatting
        SET DKn HA2             enable writing of home address 2
        SET DKn NOHA2           disable writing of home address 2
        SET DKn MODULE=n        sets modules for unit, modules 
                                can only be even. 0 to 8.
        SET DKn CHAN=n          sets channel for unit (A-D).
        SET DKn SELECT=n        sets select on channel (0 or 1).
   
Formatting is disabled by default.

Error handling is as follows:

        error                   processed as

        not attached            report error and stop

        OS I/O error            report error and stop

2.5.2 Hypertape 7340 Tape drive (HTA/B)

These come in groups of 10 units each. The controller defines which channel
the devices will be on.

        SET HTx CHAN=n          Set magtape to channel n. x = A|B.
        SET HTx SELECT=n        Sets the selection mode for the channel.

Each individual tape drive support several options: HTA used as an example.

        SET MTAn LOCKED         Sets the mag tape to be read only.
        SET MTAn WRITEENABLE    Sets the mag tape to be writeable.


2.5.3 7750 Communications Controller (COM and COML)

The 7750 is modelled as a terminal multiplexor with 33 lines.  It consists
of two device: COM is the multiplexor controller, and COML is the indivdual
lines. For the first 32 lines, the 7750 performs input and output through
Telnet sessions connected via a user-specified listening port. The ATTACH command
specifies the port to be used for Telnet sessions:

        ATTACH COM <port>       set up listening port

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being used
for other TCP/IP activities.

Each line (each unit of COML) can be set to one of twp modes: KSR-35 and
KSR-37.  In KSR-35 mode, lower case input and output characters are converted
automatically to upper case, and parity is ignored.  In KSR-37 mode, lower
case characters are left alone, and even parity is generated on input.
KSR-37 is the default.

Once COM is attached and the simulator is running, the 7750 listens
for connections on the specified port.  It assumes that any incoming
connection is a Telnet connections.  The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET COM DISCONNECT command,
or a DETACH COM command.

The 7750 implements the following special SHOW commands

        SHOW COM CONNECTIONS    displays current connections to the 7750
        SHOW COM STATISTICS     displays statistics for active connections

The 7750 implements the following special SET commands:

        SET COM DISCONNECT=n    disconnect line n
        SET COMLn LOG=filename  log output of line n to filename
        SET COMLn NOLOG         disable logging and close log file
        SET COMLn KSR35         set line n to KSR-35
        SET COMLn KSR37         set line n to KSR-37
        SET COMLn 2741          set line n to 2741
        SET COM CHAN=n          set channel for com controller.

The controller (COM) implements these registers:

        name            size    comments

        ENABLE          1       enable flag
        STATE           6       controller state
        MSGNUM          12      input message sequence number


2.6 Symbolic Display and Input

The IBM 7070 simulator implements symbolic display and input.  Display is
controlled by command line switches:

        -c                      display as BCD character
        -m                      display instruction mnemonics

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by command
line switches:

        -c                      BCD character
        -m alphabetic           instruction mnemonic
        numeric                 decimal number.

Instruction input uses standard 7070 assembler syntax.
